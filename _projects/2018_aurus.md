I worked for 6 weeks at [Drishti Works](http://www.drishti.works/) as a Robotics Engineer-Intern. During this time, I got to work on Project AURUS, which is a beach cleaning robot!

The project was in its initial stages during that time and I was involved in a diverse range of work including programming for the various sensors and functionality, developing the IMU system involving MPU6050, MPU9250, the power distribution system, wiring, and the motor driver plus encoder PCB for the robot. Also created ROS nodes using python for the interface of the Nvidia Jetson with the Arduino Due, multiple channel serial communication and using heartbeats with a watchdog timer to greatly improve system reliability.

It was the first “large-scale” kind of project that I laid my hands on, and it was super fun and exciting, mostly because of the wonderful friends that I made! Thinking of you Sahal Hashim and Sagar Eidnani :). Also thanks to Ankit Somani for his constant motivation and direct involvement in the project! I learnt a lot about the overall development of such large systems from the awesome people there and later decided to continue with Drishti for my capstone project on [Project ATLAS](https://srijalshekhar.com/projects/2018_atlas/).
