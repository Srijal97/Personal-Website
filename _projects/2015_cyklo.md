Cyklo was a point-to-point, peer-to-peer cycle sharing service. CYKLO was started in 2015 with a focus on technology-based locking solutions. I was a core part of the team and handled all of the hardware aspects needed for our automated cycle lock prototype.

Here are some videos of the prototypes created:

The server-side management and creating the smartphone application was handled by Aashish Nehete, a great friend and IT wizard, while I handled all of the hardware design and build. A custom PCB was also designed and implemented.

The following video shows the mechanism in action:

We were placed first in InterThrone 2017, an IoT contest, under the Public Transport category and awarded INR 300,000.

In August 2017, CYKLO is now a Startup recognised by the Department of Industrial and Policy Protection (DIPP Certified Startup) under the Startup India Act. However eventually it shut down as most of the founding members left for other professional pursuits.
