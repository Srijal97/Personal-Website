I love websites like Hackster, Hackaday, and Instructables where makers all around the globe get together to discuss, share and learn. With a lot of my time spent browsing around the web, talking around on forums; I always wanted to "give back" by sharing a project of my own. So, back when I just started out with Arduino and electronics, The Companion IC was the first idea I decided to go for!


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2015_companion_ic.jpg" title="The Companion IC" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/2015_companion_ic_internals.jpg" title="The Companion IC internals" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

It started out as a component tester kind-of-thing and as the design went on, I tried to add as much functionality into it as the Arduino Nano allowed. A great deal of thought and love has been put into documenting it on Instructables and Hackster.io, so it would be best if you see it directly at one of those sites:
