Hello!  

I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland.

My research interests lie at the intersection of applied control, robotics and embedded systems. As my work is highly applied, I spend the majority of my time (almost all of it if I'm honest) debugging software to ensure that our robots work reliably on the field. I am experienced in developing software and hardware to support not just the central research problem but the entire application ecosystem. I also like working with microcontrollers and embedded computers along with all the high power and low power circuits around them. 

Presently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Derek Paley on the DARPA Triage Challenge, where we build robots to perform triage in a mass casualty incident.
