Hello!  

I'm a maker, tinkerer, engineer and an aspiring researcher. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Systems Engineering - where I have fun with ciruits and software!  

I like working with microcontrollers and embedded computers along with all the high power and low power circuits around them. Run for months off a battery? [Check](). Hum with 5kWs of power? [Check]().  

Presently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Derek Paley on making e-scooters autonomously drive to a user or a parking lot.  

Oh, and I love airplanes!
