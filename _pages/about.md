Hello!  

I'm a maker, tinkerer, engineer and an aspiring researcher. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Systems Engineering - where I have fun with ciruits and software!  

My research interests lie at the intersection of applied control, robotics and embedded systems. I like working with microcontrollers and embedded computers along with all the high power and low power circuits around them. Run for months off a battery? [Check](https://srijalshekhar.com/projects/2018_rois/). Hum with 5kWs of power? [Check](https://srijalshekhar.com/projects/2019_pdc/).  

Presently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with Dr. Derek Paley on making electric scooters autonomously drive back to a parking lot and reduce the clutter they create. 

Oh, and I love airplanes!
